Top 10 Enhancement Priorities
1. Authentication & Authorization System üîê
Priority: CRITICAL - Foundation for everything else
Currently you have auth stubs but no real implementation. This is essential for your business model.
# Implement in app/auth.py
- Microsoft/Google OAuth integration
- Email domain validation against transit agencies
- Role-based access (Reader/Admin per agency)
- Vendor subscription validation
- Public vs. authenticated content routing

Impact: Enables your core business model and user segmentation Effort: Medium (OAuth libraries exist, domain validation needs agency database)
2. Agency Registration & Validation Pipeline üèõÔ∏è
Priority: HIGH - Enables user onboarding
You need a way to validate that user email domains actually belong to legitimate transit agencies.
# New models/tables needed:
- VerifiedAgencyDomains (domain, agency_id, verification_status)
- UserRegistrationRequests (email, agency_claim, status, verification_notes)
- Add email_domain field to Agency model

Implementation:
Domain verification workflow for new agencies
Manual approval process for edge cases
Email validation during registration
3. Component-Agency Relationship Management üîß
Priority: HIGH - Core functionality gap
Your AgencyFunctionImplementation model exists but the UI doesn't support managing these relationships effectively.
# Missing UI components:
- Agency-specific component management interface
- Component deployment wizard
- Version tracking and update notifications
- Status management (Active/Planned/Retired)
- Bulk import from spreadsheets/GTFS

Impact: This is the core value proposition - tracking what tech each agency uses Effort: Medium (models exist, need comprehensive UI)
6. Enhanced Search & Discovery üîç
Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH - User experience
Your current filtering is basic. Transit professionals need sophisticated discovery tools.
# Enhanced search features:
- Full-text search across components, vendors, functions
- Advanced filtering (by agency size, geography, deployment date)
- "Similar agencies" recommendations
- Technology stack comparison tools
- Integration compatibility matrix

Impact: Makes the platform actually useful for research and decision-making Effort: Medium (leverage existing filter infrastructure)
8. Agency Dashboard & Analytics üìà
Priority: MEDIUM - Value-add for agencies
Agencies need insights into their technology stack and industry trends.
# Dashboard features:
- Technology stack overview and gaps analysis
- Vendor relationship summary
- Peer comparison (anonymized)
- Upgrade/replacement recommendations
- Integration complexity scoring
- Budget planning tools
Data Model Enhancements Needed:
User Management: Extend auth to include user profiles, agency affiliations, roles
Data Provenance: Track who added/modified what data and when
Vendor Products: More detailed product/service catalog structure
Integration Standards: Better modeling of how systems connect
Quick Wins to Start With:
Implement basic OAuth - Gets you real users immediately
Add CSV import for components - Enables rapid data population
Create agency domain validation - Enables controlled user growth
Build component-agency relationship UI - Delivers core value


Goals: keep a consistent and clean user interface, easy to read, nicely styled with Tailwinds classes;
use HTMX when it makes sense, avoid excessive javascript; this app is designed to appeal to operational and technology employees who work in the transit industry, and vendors who serve that industry
