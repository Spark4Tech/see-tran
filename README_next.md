6. Enhanced Search & Discovery üîç
Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH - User experience
Your current filtering is basic. Transit professionals need sophisticated discovery tools.
# Enhanced search features:
- Full-text search across components, vendors, functions
- Advanced filtering (by agency size, geography, deployment date)
- "Similar agencies" recommendations
- Technology stack comparison tools
- Integration compatibility matrix




Goals: keep a consistent and clean user interface, easy to read, nicely styled with Tailwinds classes;
use HTMX when it makes sense, avoid excessive javascript; this app is designed to appeal to operational and technology employees who work in the transit industry, and vendors who serve that industry
