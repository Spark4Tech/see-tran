      "name": "GTFS Static Export",
      "description": "GTFS Static Export allows a transit agency to compile and share its schedule and route data in the General Transit Feed Specification format. This static dataset includes all fixed transit information—such as stops, routes, trips, timetables, and fares—packaged in a series of standardized text files. By exporting data as GTFS, the agency ensures that external applications (like journey planners, mapping services, and third-party apps) can easily consume the information and provide accurate transit directions to riders.\nThe GTFS static export is typically updated whenever service changes occur, serving as a reliable foundation for trip planning and analysis. Because GTFS is widely adopted globally as an open data standard, publishing this feed enhances the agency’s visibility across many platforms, from Google Maps to local transit apps. It also fosters transparency and innovation by enabling developers and researchers to work with up-to-date schedule data.",

Through this integration, the transit system broadcasts current updates on vehicle locations, arrival predictions, and service alerts using the GTFS Realtime format. This feed is structured as a stream of data (often using protocol buffers) that applications can poll or subscribe to, allowing riders to receive timely information about delays, early arrivals, or unexpected disruptions.\nBy adhering to the GTFS Realtime specification, the agency ensures that its real-time feed is interoperable with common transit apps and systems. This live data integration significantly improves the passenger experience, as riders can adjust their travel plans based on real-time conditions. GTFS-Realtime has become a de facto standard for live transit data, enabling consistent performance across various platforms and maintaining synchronization with the static GTFS schedule feed.",

      "description": "The CAD/AVL API connects the transit agency’s Computer-Aided Dispatch/Automatic Vehicle Location system with other software components or external services. CAD/AVL systems continuously monitor vehicle statuses by tracking bus locations, schedule adherence, and dispatch events. Through this API, real-time operational data (such as each vehicle’s GPS position, on-time performance, or incident alerts) becomes accessible to applications like control center dashboards, passenger information displays, or third-party transit apps. This interface provides endpoints for live vehicle updates, service interruptions, and other operational metrics.\nStandard web protocols ensure smooth data exchange from the CAD/AVL system. Many implementations adopt a RESTful API design, providing JSON or XML feeds of vehicle location and status. In some cases, industry standards like SIRI are employed to structure real-time transit data in a common format. By exposing CAD/AVL data through a well-defined API, the agency improves situational awareness and integration—feeding real-time fleet information into various tools (from mobile apps showing bus arrivals to internal systems for performance analysis).",

It allows riders to pay fares using contactless methods, including smart transit cards, mobile wallets, or contactless credit/debit cards, with transactions processed securely in real time. The gateway handles fare validations and card taps at readers, communicating with back-end payment servers to approve transactions or deduct fare value from accounts. This integration is critical for enabling modern payment options such as open-loop payments (using personal bank cards directly) and ensures that fare revenue is collected seamlessly and accounted for.\nTo achieve interoperability and security, the fare payment gateway adheres to international standards for contactless transactions. The system uses ISO 14443–compliant smart cards and readers, which define the physical and communication protocols for contactless cards at 13.56 MHz (as used in transit fare media worldwide). For bank card payments, it follows the EMV Contactless specifications – the global standard maintained by EMVCo for secure 'tap-to-pay' transactions. Using these standards guarantees that a wide variety of payment media (from EMV bank cards to NFC-enabled phones) can be accepted reliably while protecting sensitive payment data.",

GTFS-Flex is an extension of the GTFS format designed specifically to describe demand-responsive transportation. Using this interface, information about flexible service zones, request-based stops, and scheduling rules is provided in a standardized format. This lets trip planners and other applications integrate these non-fixed-route services alongside regular bus and train routes.\nBy integrating GTFS-Flex data, the agency improves the discoverability and usability of its on-demand transit offerings. Riders using journey planning apps can see and plan trips that include flexible services because the underlying data follows the recognized GTFS-Flex specification. This interface bridges the gap between traditional fixed schedules and dynamic routing, enabling a more inclusive trip planning experience. As of 2024, GTFS-Flex has been largely incorporated into the official GTFS specification, underscoring the transit industry’s commitment to supporting first-mile/last-mile and rural mobility through standardized data.",

      "description": "The Trip Planner API provides a programmatic way to access the transit agency’s journey planning services. External applications can send requests (specifying an origin, destination, time, etc.) and receive suggested transit itineraries that combine routes, transfers, and walking instructions. The trip planner behind the API uses the agency’s schedule data (and often real-time updates) to calculate optimal trips for riders. This integration allows third-party apps, websites, or digital assistants to offer accurate transit directions by tapping directly into the agency’s routing engine.\nTypically implemented as a RESTful web service, the Trip Planner API accepts HTTP requests with query parameters and returns structured route results in formats like JSON or XML. By following standard web API conventions, it is easy for developers to integrate and ensures broad compatibility. The underlying routing engine might be an open-source system like OpenTripPlanner or a commercial solution, but in all cases it relies on the standard GTFS datasets (plus any real-time feeds) to generate results. Offering this API expands the reach of the transit agency’s trip planning, enabling consistent and up-to-date journey information across multiple consumer platforms.",

It facilitates the transfer of data such as maintenance work orders, inventory usage, employee timekeeping, and financial transactions from transit-specific software into the central ERP system. For example, when a vehicle’s maintenance is recorded in a fleet management system, the adapter can send that record to the ERP so that parts usage and costs are reflected in the inventory and accounting modules. This integration ensures that the agency’s enterprise databases remain in sync with day-to-day transit operations, improving data consistency and organizational efficiency.\nThe adapter uses standard web service interfaces to exchange information reliably. Modern implementations often provide a REST API to push and pull data between systems (for instance, posting daily ridership figures or retrieving procurement requests in JSON format). Many ERP platforms also support SOAP-based services, offering a WSDL for structured XML messages that the adapter can utilize. By leveraging these established standards, the integration adapter seamlessly bridges transit operational software with back-office ERP modules, enabling consolidated reporting, business analytics, and streamlined workflows.",
